# Testing on a physical iPhone
Currently the easiest way is to test on iPhone is to build to an actual iphone.
A developer account is needed, so an apple ID. 
A iPhone plugged into a Mac with X-Code installed by USB cable will work. 
Change the build target in X-Code to be the connected iPhone.
Run the build. 
Select the developer account if not already added in X-Code. 
Once the build finishes, on iPhone go to settings > general > VPN & Device Management > approve the developer app
The app should be installed and usuable for testing.
